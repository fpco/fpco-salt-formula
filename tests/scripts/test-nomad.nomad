      # The "template" stanza instructs Nomad to manage a template, such as

      #
      # For more information and examples on the "template" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/template.html

      # The "template" stanza can also be used to create environment variables

      # when data pulled from Consul or Vault changes.

      # The "vault" stanza instructs the Nomad client to acquire a token from
      # a HashiCorp Vault server. The Nomad servers must be configured and
      # authorized to communicate with Vault. By default, Nomad will inject
      # The token into the job via an environment variable and make the token
      # available to the "template" stanza. The Nomad client handles the renewal
      # and revocation of the Vault token.
      #
