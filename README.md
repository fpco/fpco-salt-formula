## FPCO Salt Formula

Here you will find recipes for setting up a host system (or environment) in a
particular way. The focus is generally on building, hosting, or supporting one
or more applications and services.


### About the formula

The formula (recipes) express desired states of being for the host system,
declaring the details of the users, packages, files, services, and all other
aspects of the underlying UNIX system that should be present, absent, running,
or not, enabled or disabled, etc on the host.


### What you will find here

* Salt Formula (`.sls`, `.py`);
* shell scripts (`.sh`), minimal;
* and lots of app/service config files, generally as (jinja)[] templates.


## How to Use

More information will come. For the interested, start with `bootstrap.sh` here
